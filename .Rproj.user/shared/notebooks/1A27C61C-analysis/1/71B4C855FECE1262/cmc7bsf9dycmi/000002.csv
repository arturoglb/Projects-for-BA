"0","#Mandy - shouldn't use sum function for airpol because the unit of airpol is per cubicmetre. If we wanna use sum then we need to multiple cubicmetre to that numbers. I think we should use average instead of sum. But for mortality, we can use sum because the numbers represent the numbers of dead people in each disease."
